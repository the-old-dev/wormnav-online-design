# wormnav-online
This project aims to provide a smartphone independent navigation solution for garmin smartwatches which have no navigation capabilities of the shelf.

The [wormnav project](https://github.com/andan67/wormnav) does that allready provide a garmin smartwatch app for that purpuse. And that smartwatch app is based on a custom Android Phone Companion App, which delivers the navigation data to it. IPhone users can not use wormnav, because there is no IPhone Companion App.

wormnav-online tries to provide a web based solution without the need for a custom companion smartwatch app. wormnav-online will only need the [Garmin Connect IQ App](https://connect.garmin.com/).

wormnav-online has currently no plans to provide a ready to use solution. The project will provide the code and documentation only.
